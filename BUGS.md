# Bugs — Signal Circuit

*Updated: Day 61 — Harden Week 1, Day 4 (2026-04-26) — Fix Everything*

## Open Bugs

*(none — all 3 P2 bugs fixed on Day 61)*

## Cosmetic / Minor Observations (Not Bugs)
- AudioContext warnings on page load (expected — resumes after first user gesture)
- Collection shows 4 of 6 completed levels (expected — only levels with saved preview data appear)
- Level 3 shows ★☆☆ in Review Suggested but ★★★🧠 on the card (review tracks worst score, card shows best — working as intended)
- Deprecated meta tag warning: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` should be `mobile-web-app-capable` (cosmetic, non-breaking)

### Day 61 — Harden Week 1, Day 4: Fix Everything

**P2 — Blitz Mode Bar Persists on Level Select** ✅
- **Fix:** `showLevelSelect()` in `js/main.js` now defensively clears any active blitz timer, sets `blitzMode = false`, and hides `#blitz-hud` (`display: none`) on every transition into the level select screen.
- **Why it works:** The HUD is now torn down by the *destination* screen, not just the *source* mode's exit handler. Every navigation path into level select (Back button, programmatic `showLevelSelect()`, post-completion auto-return, mode-switch, etc.) is covered.

**P2 — Daily Leaderboard Duplicate Name** ✅
- **Fix:** `DailyLeaderboard.generatePseudoScores()` now tracks used names in a `Set`. On collision, it linearly probes forward through `DAILY_LB_NAMES`. If the entire 40-name pool is exhausted (last 10 of 50 entries), it appends `_<i>` as a deterministic fallback. Top 10 displayed entries are always unique.
- **Verified:** Headless test across 10 distinct date seeds (today, +1d, +5d, +30d, +90d, +180d, +365d, holidays): top-10 unique = 10/10 in every case; full 50-entry list also fully unique post-suffix.

**P2 — Stats: Empty Sessions Recorded** ✅
- **Fix:** Two-layer defense.
  1. `_logSession()` in `js/main.js` early-returns when `sessionLevels <= 0`, so future page-navigation-only sessions never get persisted.
  2. `renderStats()` in `js/ui.js` filters `s.levelsPlayed > 0` before rendering Recent Sessions, hiding any legacy 0-level rows already saved in localStorage.

**Cache bust:** `index.html` `?v=1777216661`, `sw.js` `CACHE_NAME = 'signal-circuit-v42'`.

### Earlier Audits

#### Audit Results — Day 60 (Harden Week 1, Day 3: Edge Cases & Stress)

13/13 stress tests passed (rapid gate placement, wire drawing during animation, window resize, localStorage clear, keyboard navigation, colorblind mode, light/dark mode, performance with many wires/gates, empty simulation, undo/redo, text size, blitz entry/exit, localStorage capacity). Console: 0 JS errors. No new bugs found; all 3 P2 bugs from Days 58–59 confirmed open going into Day 4.

#### Audit Results — Day 59 (Harden Week 1, Day 2: Level Playthrough)

All 5 challenge modes tested (Daily / Random / Blitz / Speedrun / Sandbox). Community level "The Implication" played successfully. Star/hint systems verified. 0 JS errors; new P2 bug (Blitz bar persistence) found.
