# Bugs — Signal Circuit

*Updated: Day 79 — Prune Week 2, Day 3 (2026-05-17) — Code Cleanup (Cycle 2)*

## Open Bugs

*(none — Day 79 was a Prune Week net-negative LOC pass; 8 orphan JS
identifiers + 5 orphan CSS blocks removed without surfacing any new bugs.
All verification ran with 0 console errors.)*

## Day 79 — Prune Week 2, Day 3 (Code Cleanup) summary

**Build under test:** `?v=1779638400`, `sw.js CACHE_NAME = 'signal-circuit-v54'`
**Result:** 0 new bugs, **−180 LOC** (target was ≥−100).

Removed (all callsites verified dead before deletion):

- **`ui.showFirstLaunchDifficultyModal`** — only caller was Day 78 Cut #5; silent-default replaced it.
- **`#weekly-puzzle-btn`** DOM node + `setupCompetitiveModes` click handler + `setVis` gating call + `.weekly-btn` CSS — Tournament subsumed it Day 72.
- **Weekly notification path** — `WEEKLY_NOTIF_KEY` const, `checkWeeklyNotification()`, `_getWeekNumber()`, `_showWeeklyToast()`, `#weekly-toast` CSS, `notif-weekly-btn` button + Settings entry.
- **`AchievementManager.{checkLightning, checkEclipseRun, checkArchitect, isMythic}`** — Day 71 added these wrappers but every mythic unlock fires inline at the real trigger site.
- **`InfiniteRunManager._showHud`** — never called; `_updateHud` handles display.
- **`InteractiveTutorial.getCurrentStep`** — never called.
- **Orphan CSS**: `#mute-btn` (3 rules — element never existed), `#gate-count-display` (2 rules — never rendered), dead light-mode selectors `.modal-content` / `#confirm-modal-box` / `#creator-content` / `#mastery-content` (wrong IDs; real ones are `#confirm-modal-content`, `#creator-config-content`, `#mastery-tree-content`), `#hint-penalty` from compound static-info selector.

**Verification:** 12 CDP checks + 3-test regression sweep, all pass, 0 console errors. End-game overflow count (40 ⋯) and Tier-2 staircase deltas (0/3/5/8/11/16) confirmed no Day 78 regression. Tournament + Settings→Difficulty chooser both still work after the trim.

## Day 78 — Prune Week 2, Day 2 (Design Simplification) summary

**Build under test:** `?v=1779552000`, `sw.js CACHE_NAME = 'signal-circuit-v53'`
**Result:** 0 new bugs, 5 Tier 1 cuts shipped from `PRUNE_REPORT.md`.

- **Cut #1 — Per-card overflow menu**: `👁 Solution` + `🏆 Gate Limit` collapsed into a single `⋯` corner button per completed card with a popover.
- **Cut #2 — Smooth Tier-2 reveal**: `applyProgressGating()` now uses 5 thresholds (g6/g9/g12/g15/g18) instead of two.
- **Cut #3 — Retire Puzzle of the Week**: Tournament fully subsumes it; `weekly-puzzle-btn` hidden at every tier.
- **Cut #4 — Drop L1 hint footer**: meta-rule footer hidden on levels 1–3 (no hints used yet); resurfaces from L4.
- **Cut #5 — Silent-default difficulty modal**: brand-new players auto-set to Standard + one-time toast; Settings → Difficulty Mode unchanged.

Net wins: end-game level-select drops 40 × 2 sub-buttons → 40 × 1 overflow button (−50% per-card visual weight), Tier-2 cliff replaced by a 3 → 5 → 8 → 11 → 16 staircase, two cold-start ceremonies removed (difficulty modal + L1 hint footer).

Live CDP verification (5 cut suites, multi-seed gating sweep, modal/toast lifecycle): 0 console errors.

## Day 76 — Harden Week 2, Day 4 (Fix Everything) summary

**Build under test:** `?v=1779465600`, `sw.js CACHE_NAME = 'signal-circuit-v52'`
**Result:** 0 open bugs at start of day, 0 open bugs at end. Day pivoted to closing the two verification-only learnings flagged on Day 75:

1. **`GameState.seedProgress(count, opts)`** — new dev/Harden helper on `js/main.js`. Synthetically marks levels 1..count as completed (with `_seeded:true` markers and configurable `stars` / `pureLogic` / `hardcore`) so future Harden harnesses can reach tier-gated UI (Tournament, Random Challenge, Adaptive, Infinite, Customize, Mastery Tree, …) without 18 manual completions. Non-destructive on real play. Returns a summary object for assertions.
2. **`runSimulation()` re-entry contract** — 7-line doc comment added directly above the existing `isAnimating` guard codifying the property Day 75 verified empirically: while a sim is in flight, additional invocations are no-ops; after completion the flag clears so subsequent clicks always start a fresh sim; no debounce beyond "one in flight at a time".

Live verification (12 assertions): build identity unified, seedProgress(18) reveals 13 tier3 buttons, cold start hides them all, non-destructive at lower stars, clear option wipes cleanly, Level 1 core loop unaffected, RUN-spam guard holds, 0 console errors.

Written up in `reviews/harden-cycle-2-week-summary.md`. Cycle 2 Harden Week closes one day early.

### Day 74 — P2: Speedrun HUD Persists on Level Select ✅
- **Found:** Day 74 (Cycle 2 Harden Day 2). After entering Speedrun Mode and returning to the level select (e.g., via the Back button bypassing `stopSpeedrunMode()`), `#speedrun-hud` remained `display:flex` and `speedrunMode` stayed `true`.
- **Root cause:** Day 61 comment in `showLevelSelect()` claimed "Defensive Blitz/Speedrun HUD cleanup" but only the Blitz branch was wired. Speedrun was missed.
- **Fix:** Sibling defensive cleanup block added to `showLevelSelect()` (`js/main.js`) right below the Blitz cleanup. Clears `speedrunTimer` + `speedrunStart`, sets `speedrunMode=false`, hides `#speedrun-hud`.
- **Verified live:** Patched `showLevelSelect` injected into the running build cleared all three (mode flag, timer, HUD) on transition. Symmetric to the Day 61 Blitz fix.
- **Cache bust:** `index.html` `?v=1779379200`, `sw.js` `CACHE_NAME = 'signal-circuit-v51'`.

## Cosmetic / Minor Observations (Not Bugs)
- AudioContext warnings on page load (expected — resumes after first user gesture)
- Collection shows 4 of 6 completed levels (expected — only levels with saved preview data appear)
- Level 3 shows ★☆☆ in Review Suggested but ★★★🧠 on the card (review tracks worst score, card shows best — working as intended)
- Deprecated meta tag warning: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` should be `mobile-web-app-capable` (cosmetic, non-breaking)

### Audit Results — Day 73 (Harden Week 2, Day 1: Full Interaction Audit) — Cycle 2

**Build:** ?v=1779292800, sw v50 (Day 72 Weekly Tournament + Cycle Polish)

**Screens tested (all rendering, 0 console errors):**
- Level Select (tier-gated: cold start 2 buttons → tier3 reveals 18 nav buttons after 20 levels seeded)
- Gameplay Screen (Level 1 entry; truth table 4 rows; RUN / Quick Test / Hint / Clear / Prev / Next / Panel toggle / KB wiring / Back / Encyclopedia / Shortcuts — all visible)
- Settings Modal (14 buttons + SFX/Music sliders; 9 toggles flipped successfully: Colorblind, Text size, Simplified, Accessible Wiring, Light/Dark, Daily/Weekly/Streak notifications)
- Difficulty Mode button → opens nested confirm-modal with 3 options (Relaxed / Standard / Hardcore)
- How to Play modal (opens + closes cleanly)
- Daily Challenge screen (Back + ⚡ Start Today's Challenge); start → gameplay with isDaily=true
- Random Challenge screen (2 sliders: input-count, output-count; Generate / Push My Limits / Clear Scores); generate → isChallengeMode=true
- Tournament screen (3 tabs: This Week, My Best, Archive); archive shows 8 weeks with Play/Replay buttons; archive replay sets isTournament + isTournamentArchive=true
- Infinite Pre-Screen (Back + Start Run)
- Blitz Ladder (immediate gameplay entry; HUD does NOT persist after Back — Day 61 fix verified)
- Speedrun Mode (immediate gameplay entry; HUD does NOT persist after Back)
- Sandbox config screen (Back + Start Sandbox)
- Creator config screen (Back + Play Level + Share Link)
- Adaptive Challenge button → direct entry to gameplay-screen

**Modals tested (all rendering with content):**
- Gate Encyclopedia (rich content, gate symbols visible)
- Achievements (tier-sorted: 🌌 Mythic → 💎 Diamond → 🥇 Gold → 🥈 Silver → 🥉 Bronze; chase progress visible)
- Stats (3 charts render: chart-daily-playtime 480x140, chart-stars-over-time 480x140, chart-skill-progression 480x100)
- Customize (Wire Colors / Gate Skins / Board Themes sections with cosmetic-card preview swatches)
- Mastery Tree (5-tier grid: Basics → Combinations → Universal → etc. with mastery checkmarks for completed gates)
- Circuit Collection (empty state message for 0 saved levels — expected)
- Logic Profile (level count 14/29 · ⭐ 42/ — stats render)

**Console:**
- 0 JS errors across all paths
- Only AudioContext autoplay warnings (expected; resumes after user gesture)

**Day 61 fix regression checks (still in place):**
- Blitz HUD: 'none' on level-select after Blitz exit ✅
- Speedrun HUD: 'none' on level-select after Speedrun exit ✅ (bonus check)
- Daily Leaderboard: dedup logic in place
- Stats: _logSession filter in place

**Result: 0 new bugs. Audit pass.**

### Day 61 — Harden Week 1, Day 4: Fix Everything

**P2 — Blitz Mode Bar Persists on Level Select** ✅
- **Fix:** `showLevelSelect()` in `js/main.js` now defensively clears any active blitz timer, sets `blitzMode = false`, and hides `#blitz-hud` (`display: none`) on every transition into the level select screen.
- **Why it works:** The HUD is now torn down by the *destination* screen, not just the *source* mode's exit handler. Every navigation path into level select (Back button, programmatic `showLevelSelect()`, post-completion auto-return, mode-switch, etc.) is covered.

**P2 — Daily Leaderboard Duplicate Name** ✅
- **Fix:** `DailyLeaderboard.generatePseudoScores()` now tracks used names in a `Set`. On collision, it linearly probes forward through `DAILY_LB_NAMES`. If the entire 40-name pool is exhausted (last 10 of 50 entries), it appends `_<i>` as a deterministic fallback. Top 10 displayed entries are always unique.
- **Verified:** Headless test across 10 distinct date seeds (today, +1d, +5d, +30d, +90d, +180d, +365d, holidays): top-10 unique = 10/10 in every case; full 50-entry list also fully unique post-suffix.

**P2 — Stats: Empty Sessions Recorded** ✅
- **Fix:** Two-layer defense.
  1. `_logSession()` in `js/main.js` early-returns when `sessionLevels <= 0`, so future page-navigation-only sessions never get persisted.
  2. `renderStats()` in `js/ui.js` filters `s.levelsPlayed > 0` before rendering Recent Sessions, hiding any legacy 0-level rows already saved in localStorage.

**Cache bust:** `index.html` `?v=1777216661`, `sw.js` `CACHE_NAME = 'signal-circuit-v42'`.
